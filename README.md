# BrainJam: Brain-Mediated Music and Creativity Research

A research repository for PhD work exploring the intersection of neuroscience, creativity, and generative music systems.

## Overview

This project investigates how brain activity patterns relate to creative musical experiences, agency in music-making, and psychological well-being. The focus is on understanding the cognitive and affective dimensions of musical creativity rather than literal "mind reading" or control paradigms.

### Research Questions

- How do neural correlates of creativity manifest during music listening and creation?
- Can we map brain states associated with creative agency to generative music parameters?
- What is the relationship between brain-mediated music interaction and psychological well-being?
- How can neuroscience-informed systems enhance rather than replace human creativity?

## Key Components

### Neural Signal Processing
- **fMRI**: Hemodynamic responses for spatial localization of creative processes
- **fNIRS**: Portable cortical oxygenation monitoring for naturalistic settings
- **EEG**: High temporal resolution for dynamic creative states

### Generative Audio Models
- Transfer learning from pretrained music generation models
- Latent space exploration conditioned on neural features
- Real-time audio synthesis from brain state proxies

### Psychological Framework
- **Creativity**: Divergent thinking, flow states, and novel idea generation
- **Agency**: Sense of control and authorship in music creation
- **Well-being**: Emotional regulation, self-expression, and therapeutic potential

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.8+
python --version

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start

1. Explore the literature review in `literature/`
2. Review available models in `models/README.md`
3. Run example notebooks in `notebooks/`
4. Experiment with the toy interface in `toy_interface/`

## Research Approach

This project emphasizes:
- **Psychology-first**: Understanding cognitive and affective mechanisms
- **Human-centered**: Augmenting rather than replacing human creativity
- **Responsible innovation**: Careful consideration of ethics and limitations
- **Open science**: Transparent methods and reproducible research

## Important Notes

⚠️ **This is exploratory research**: Results should be interpreted with appropriate caution given the current limitations of neural decoding technologies.

🧠 **Not mind reading**: We study statistical patterns and correlations, not direct thought decoding. Neural signals are noisy, individual, and context-dependent.

🎵 **Creative augmentation**: The goal is to create new tools for creative expression, not to automate creativity away.
