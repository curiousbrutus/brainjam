## Agency and Control

### Sense of Agency in Action
**Haggard, P. (2017)** - *Sense of agency in the human brain*
- **Link**: https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2017.14
- **Summary**: Neural mechanisms of agency involve comparing predictions with outcomes; sense of control emerges from this process.
- **Relevance**: Critical for designing brain-music interfaces that preserve creative agency.

### Predictive Processing in Music

- **Link**: https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01111
- **Summary**: Brain constantly predicts upcoming musical events; violations create surprise and engagement.
- **Relevance**: Prediction error signals could inform generative music systems.

## Well-Being and Music

### Music for Mental Health
**Fancourt, D., & Finn, S. (2019)** - *What is the evidence on the role of the arts in improving health and well-being?*
- **Link**: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553773/
- **Summary**: Comprehensive WHO review showing music interventions benefit mental health, stress, and well-being.
- **Relevance**: Establishes therapeutic potential of music-based interventions.

### Music-Making and Well-Being
**Creech, A., et al. (2013)** - *The power of music in the lives of older adults*
- **Link**: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258183735_The_power_of_music_in_the_lives_of_older_adults
- **Summary**: Active music-making enhances well-being more than passive listening.
- **Relevance**: Supports focus on creative participation rather than passive brain-music systems.

## Individual Differences

### Musical Training and Brain Plasticity
**Herholz, S. C., & Zatorre, R. J. (2012)** - *Musical Training as a Framework for Brain Plasticity*
- **Link**: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2012.10.011
- **Summary**: Musical training induces structural and functional brain changes in auditory, motor, and multimodal areas.
- **Relevance**: Individual differences in musical expertise affect neural representations.

### Creativity Across Domains
**Dietrich, A., & Kanso, R. (2010)** - *A review of EEG, ERP, and neuroimaging studies of creativity and insight*
- **Link**: https://doi.org/10.1037/a0019749
- **Summary**: Creativity involves domain-general and domain-specific neural processes.
- **Relevance**: Brain signatures of creativity may partially generalize across creative tasks.

## Multimodal Integration

### Cross-Modal Creativity
**Ritter, S. M., & Ferguson, S. (2017)** - *Happy creativity: Listening to happy music facilitates divergent thinking*
