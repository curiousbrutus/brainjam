# Ethics and Accessibility

This directory contains guidelines for ethical and accessible use of BrainJam.

## Overview

BrainJam is a **performance instrument**, not a clinical or neuroscience tool.
Ethics focuses on:
- Performer consent and understanding
- System transparency
- Accessibility for diverse users
- Responsible framing and communication

## Contents

### Core Documents

For detailed ethical guidelines, see:
- **[`../ethics.md`](../ethics.md)** — Main ethics document
  - Performer consent principles
  - System transparency requirements
  - Data privacy guidelines
  - Accessibility considerations
  - Risk assessment and mitigation

### Key Principles

1. **Informed Consent**
   - Performers understand that brain signals are control inputs, not decoded thoughts
   - Clear explanation of system behavior
   - Right to withdraw at any time

2. **System Transparency**
   - All control mappings are visible and explainable
   - No hidden automation
   - Performers can inspect and modify system behavior

3. **Accessibility**
   - Design for neurodivergent and disabled performers
   - Multiple control modalities (EEG, keyboard, MIDI, etc.)
   - No normative assumptions about "correct" signals
   - Adaptable to individual needs

4. **Accurate Framing**
   - NOT brain reading or mind decoding
   - NOT autonomous AI
   - NOT clinical or therapeutic
   - IS a performance instrument with optional biophysical control

## Quick Reference

### ✓ Ethical Uses

- Live musical performance
- Creative exploration and experimentation
- Research on human-AI interaction
- Education and outreach
- Accessible music-making

### ✗ Unethical Uses

- Surveillance or monitoring without consent
- Clinical/diagnostic applications
- Deceptive marketing ("mind reading")
- Discriminatory selection based on neural signals
- Any use that reduces performer agency

## Accessibility Features

### Multiple Control Modes

BrainJam supports various input methods:
- **EEG/fNIRS** — Optional biophysical control
- **Keyboard** — Manual control with key mappings
- **MIDI** — Standard music controller support
- **OSC** — Network-based control protocols
- **Mock signals** — Testing without hardware

### Design for Neurodiversity

- **No baseline required** — System works without calibration
- **No "optimal" signals** — All brain patterns are valid
- **Adaptable mappings** — Customize to individual preferences
- **Low cognitive load** — Minimal visual/audio complexity
- **Clear documentation** — Accessible technical information

### Assistive Features

- **Keyboard alternatives** — Full functionality without EEG
- **Adjustable latency** — Balance responsiveness vs. stability
- **Manual override** — Always available
- **Simplified modes** — Reduced complexity options
- **Clear visual feedback** — Understand system state

## Consent Template

See [`../ethics.md`](../ethics.md) for a full consent template.

**Key points to communicate**:
1. BrainJam is a musical instrument, not mind reading
2. Brain signals are continuous control parameters
3. You maintain creative control at all times
4. You can use keyboard/MIDI instead of EEG
5. You can withdraw or stop at any time

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Latency too high for real-time performance  
**Mitigation**: Measure and optimize, provide latency feedback

**Risk**: Audio glitches or dropouts  
**Mitigation**: Robust error handling, fallback modes

**Risk**: System unpredictability frustrates performer  
**Mitigation**: Clear mappings, practice time, manual controls

### Social Risks

**Risk**: Audience thinks AI is autonomous  
**Mitigation**: Clear framing in program notes and presentations

**Risk**: Media misrepresents as "mind reading"  
**Mitigation**: Proactive accurate communication

**Risk**: Performers feel lack of control  
**Mitigation**: Transparent mappings, hybrid control modes

### Ethical Risks

**Risk**: System used for surveillance  
**Mitigation**: Clear ethical guidelines, no remote monitoring features

**Risk**: Clinical/therapeutic claims made  
**Mitigation**: Explicit disclaimers, accurate framing

**Risk**: Accessibility barriers exclude users  
**Mitigation**: Multiple control modes, adaptable design
