# Ethics for BrainJam Performance System

## Introduction

BrainJam is a **musical performance instrument**, not a clinical or neuroscience tool.
Ethics centers on **performer consent, system transparency, and accessibility**.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Performer Consent

**Principle**: Performers must understand what the system does and does not do.

**Key Points**:
- Explain that brain signals are **control inputs**, not decoded thoughts
- Clarify what data is collected (if any) and how it's used
- Make it clear that **no mental content is being "read"**
- Allow performers to opt out or withdraw at any time

**In Practice**:
- Provide clear system documentation before performances
- Demonstrate the system with mock/keyboard controls first
- Explain control mappings explicitly
- Never claim the system "reads minds" or "decodes intentions"

---

### 2. System Transparency

**Principle**: Performers should understand how their input controls the output.

**Key Points**:
- All control mappings should be explainable and visible
- No hidden automation or black-box behavior
- Performers can inspect and modify mappings
- System behavior is predictable and rehearseable

**In Practice**:
- Visualize control parameters in real time
- Provide mapping diagrams and documentation
- Allow manual override and hybrid control modes
- Make AI behavior explicit, not mysterious

**Example**:
```
Control 1 (0.7) → tempo_density (0.7) → More frequent events
Control 2 (0.3) → harmonic_tension (0.3) → Consonant harmonies
```

---

### 3. Unpredictability as Performance Feature

**Principle**: Some randomness is **performative**, not a technical flaw.

**Key Points**:
- Live performance includes uncertainty and spontaneity
- AI co-performer may surprise, like a human collaborator
- Unpredictability can be embraced, not eliminated
- Performers can choose their comfort level with system autonomy

**In Practice**:
- Distinguish technical glitches from artistic randomness
- Allow performers to adjust AI responsiveness vs. autonomy
- Frame surprises as creative opportunities
- Provide "safety" modes for risk-averse performances

---

### 4. Accessibility and Inclusion

**Principle**: Design for **neurodivergent and disabled performers**.

**Key Points**:
- Do not assume "normal" or "optimal" brain signals
- Support diverse cognitive and sensory profiles
- Avoid pathologizing difference
- Make the system adaptable to individual needs

**Accessibility Features**:
- **No required baseline**: System works without calibration
- **Multiple control modes**: EEG, keyboard, MIDI, OSC
- **Adjustable mappings**: Personalize to individual preferences
- **Low sensory load**: Minimal visual/audio clutter
- **Alternative interfaces**: Not everyone uses EEG

**Avoid**:
- ✗ Claiming one brain pattern is "better" than another
- ✗ Requiring neurotypical cognitive profiles
- ✗ Medical framing of cognitive differences
- ✗ Inaccessible technical jargon without explanation

---

### 5. Data Privacy (If Applicable)

**Principle**: If any data is recorded, protect performer privacy.

**Key Points**:
- Minimize data collection (only what's needed)
- Anonymize any recordings
- Secure storage and transmission
- Clear retention and deletion policies
- Never share performer data without explicit consent

**In Practice**:
- Default to **no recording** for casual use
- Recording only with explicit consent for specific purposes
- Data used only for system improvement, not external research
- Performers can request deletion at any time

---

## What BrainJam Is NOT

### NOT Clinical or Medical

- ✗ Not a medical device
- ✗ Not for diagnosis or treatment
- ✗ Not subject to medical device regulations
- ✗ No claims about health or therapy

### NOT Neuroscience Research

- ✗ Not studying brain mechanisms
- ✗ Not testing neural decoding accuracy
- ✗ Not optimizing for signal quality
- ✗ Psychology is for evaluation, not the focus

### NOT Mind Reading

- ✗ Not decoding thoughts or intentions
- ✗ Not inferring mental states
- ✗ Not predicting behavior or preferences
- ✗ Brain signals are continuous control parameters, period

## Ethical Guidelines for Use

### For Performers

✓ **Do**:
- Understand that EEG is one control option among many
- Experiment with different control modes (keyboard, MIDI, etc.)
- Customize mappings to your preferences
- Embrace or constrain unpredictability as you wish
- Ask questions about system behavior

✗ **Avoid**:
- Expecting the system to "read your mind"
- Thinking there's a "correct" way to use it
- Feeling pressure to use EEG if you prefer other controls

### For Researchers/Developers

✓ **Do**:
- Frame as performance instrument, not neuroscience tool
- Prioritize performer agency and control
- Make system behavior transparent and inspectable
- Design for accessibility and diverse users
- Listen to performer feedback

✗ **Avoid**:
- Claiming to decode mental states
- Marketing language about "mind control"
- Opaque or black-box system behavior
- Normative assumptions about "optimal" signals
- Ignoring latency or responsiveness issues

### For Audiences

✓ **Do**:
- Understand BrainJam as an **instrument**, like a guitar or keyboard
- Recognize performer skill and creative choices
- Appreciate AI as a **co-performer**, not autonomous
- Ask questions about how it works

✗ **Avoid**:
- Assuming the performer's thoughts are being "read"
- Attributing all creativity to the AI
- Mystifying the technology as "magic"

## Ethical Use Cases

### ✓ Acceptable Uses

1. **Live musical performance**
   - Solo or ensemble performances
   - Improvisation and composition
   - Rehearsal and practice

2. **Creative exploration**
   - Experimenting with new control paradigms
   - Exploring AI–human collaboration
   - Developing new musical techniques

3. **Research on interaction**
   - Studying performer agency and control
   - Evaluating system responsiveness

   - Measuring flow and engagement

4. **Education and outreach**
   - Demonstrating creative AI
   - Teaching about performance systems
   - Workshops and masterclasses

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risks (Acceptable)

- **Creative frustration**: System may not respond as expected
  - *Mitigation*: Provide manual controls, training time
  
- **Technical glitches**: Audio dropouts, latency spikes
  - *Mitigation*: Robust error handling, fallback modes

- **Performance anxiety**: Pressure to use new technology
  - *Mitigation*: Optional EEG, hybrid modes, practice time

### Medium Risks (Manage Carefully)

- **Misattribution of creativity**: Audience thinks AI is autonomous

## Red Flags to Avoid

When using or communicating about BrainJam:

- ✗ "BrainJam reads your thoughts"
- ✗ "AI detects your mental state"
- ✗ "The system decodes your intentions"

## Continuous Ethical Reflection

Ethics is not a one-time checklist. Regularly ask:

1. **Agency**: Are performers in control?
2. **Transparency**: Do users understand the system?
3. **Accessibility**: Who is included or excluded?
4. **Privacy**: Is data handled responsibly?
5. **Framing**: Are we communicating accurately?
